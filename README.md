# mastodon-json-blocklist

A very simple service that synchronizes the Mastodon federation domain block list with a remote JSON file, e.g. a file
inside a remote Git repository.

We use this service for our collaborative [goosefans/goosetodon](https://github.com/goosefans/goosetodon) repository to
make it easy for everyone to suggest changes to the blocklist of [our Mastodon instance](https://social.goose.rodeo).

***Documentation follows soon.***
